# Contribute with Docs

All efforts to contribute to the [Docs](https://strapi.io/documentation/3.0.0-beta.x/) are highly appreciated, we recommend you talk to a maintainer prior to spending a lot of time making a pull request that may not align with the project roadmap. You are welcome to to create tutorials, articles and videos for your own blog or channels without speaking to a maintainer.

## General Guidelines

## Documentation

The documentation is categorized into four different **types of content**:

- Tutorials
- How-to's
- Reference Topics
- Explanations

### Tutorials

A **Tutorial** is defined as a complete set of instructions that take the reader through to the completion of a specific end, such as a project or complete working application. The purpose of tutorials is to teach concepts and show how to generally accomplish specific actions using Strapi.

Examples include the [Building a Static Blog using Gatsby and Strapi](https://blog.strapi.io/building-a-static-website-using-gatsby-and-strapi/) tutorial and [Cooking a Deliveroo Clone](https://blog.strapi.io/strapi-next-setup/) tutorial.

### How-to's

A **How-to** is defined as a a step-by-step guide that shows how to solve a specific problem or accomplish a specific task.

Examples include the [Digital Ocean Deployment Guide](/3.0.0-beta.x/guides/deployment.html#digital-ocean) and [How to install MongoDB Locally](/3.0.0-beta.x/guides/databases.html#install-mongodb-locally).

### Reference Topics

**Reference Topics** are those topics that are resources to bookmark and used as a reference.

Examples include the [Models Guide](/3.0.0-beta.x/guides/models.html#how-to-create-a-model) and the [Controllers Guide](/3.0.0-beta.x/guides/controllers.html).

### Explanations

**Explanations** cover _why_ something was done and is geared towards providing an understanding behind the choices made through the course of the development of Strapi. These are generally written as **Articles** and found in the [Strapi Blog](https://blog.strapi.io).

Examples include [Why we split the management of the Admin user and the Front-end Users](https://blog.strapi.io/why-we-split-the-management-of-the-admin-users-and-end-users/) and [Restricting Permissions in Strapi Admin](https://blog.strapi.io/admin-permissions/).

These four categories follow roughly the recommendations found in this article about [documention by Divio](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/). We recommend reading it for a complete understanding.

## The Workflow

The Workflow includes:

- The [Technical Requirements and the Installation of the Docs](/3.0.0-beta.x/community/contribute-with-docs.html#technical-requirements) in your development environment.
- [Understanding the Docs Structure](/3.0.0-beta.x/community/contribute-with-docs.html#understanding-the-docs-structure)
- [Adding/modifying/deleting Content](/3.0.0-beta.x/community/contribute-with-docs.html#adding-modifying-deleting-content)
- [Submitting an externally hosted tutorial](/3.0.0-beta.x/community/contribute-with-docs.html#submitting-an-externally-hosted-tutorial)
- How to use the [Docs Style Guide](/3.0.0-beta.x/community/contribute-with-docs.html#docs-style-guide) to write better Docs.

### Technical Requirements

- You have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) at v10.x.x
- You are familiar with Git, and have it installed on your development environment.

1. Ensure you're using the [required versions of Node.js and npm](/3.0.0-beta.x/getting-started/install-requirements.html).
2. Fork the [Strapi repository](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) [to your own GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo).
3. Clone your Strapi repository:

`Path: ./Projects/`

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/strapi.git
```

4. Install the dependencies **for the docs** section of the monorepo:

`Path: ./Projects/`

```bash
cd strapi/docs
npm install
```

5. Start the docs development server and open documentation in browser:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then, navigate to [http://localhost:8080/documentation/](http://localhost:8080/documentation/).

You should now have a running instance of the documentation. Hot reload is activated in development. The next section will explain the organization of the documentation.

### Understanding the Docs Structure

The Strapi docs are power by [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). The docs live in a folder called **docs**. `Path: ./strapi/docs`. The _VuePress_ installation lives in this folder. It has a separate installation and separate dependencies from the rest of the monorepo.

Only Version **3.0.0-beta.x** is being maintained. And therefore, only the documentation for this version is being maintained. The documentation is located at `./docs/3.0.0-beta.x/`. Here you will find all the content and assets for the documentation.

The _folder names_ in the file directory correspond to the different sections in the left-hand menu. For example, the folder called, "Getting Started", corresponds to the section called, "Getting Started". However, the left-menu titles are controlled by the `h1` tag at the top of the file.

If you add a page or folder, you will do it in the config file of the Beta docs. `Path: ./docs/.versions/3.0.0-beta.x.js/`

If you wanted to add a page under `Getting Started` and the file is called `example.md`, you would save the file in the folder called `/getting-started`. Next, you would modify the config file like the example below:

`Path: ./docs/.versions/3.0.0-beta.x.js/`

```js
module.exports = [
  {
    collapsable: false,
    title: 'ðŸš€ Getting started',
    children: [
      '/3.0.0-beta.x/getting-started/introduction',
      '/3.0.0-beta.x/getting-started/install-requirements',
      '/3.0.0-beta.x/getting-started/quick-start',
      '/3.0.0-beta.x/getting-started/quick-start-tutorial',
      '/3.0.0-beta.x/getting-started/example',  // <- Added here
    ],
  },

```

### Docs Style Guide

This style guide exists in order to show and explain the standards and style of how our documentation is written. We are offering this style guide in order to help you stay consistent with the existing documentation. More important, these suggestions and this guide have been found to help communicate complex topics effectively.
